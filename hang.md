What is IRIS user portrait analysis module?
Answer: The IRIS user portrait analysis module is a data analysis and marketing tool that is used to develop a user portrait based on various data sources, such as user behavior, demographics, and purchase history, and to provide insights into user behavior and preferences.

What is DMP?
Answer: DMP stands for Data Management Platform, which is a centralized system for collecting, organizing, and analyzing large sets of data from various sources.

How did you design and implement the label system for the portrait module?
Answer: I designed and implemented the label system for the portrait module by developing a set of rules and criteria for labeling users based on their behavior and characteristics, and by developing a system for assigning labels to users based on these rules and criteria.

What is ClickHouse?
Answer: ClickHouse is an open-source columnar database management system that is optimized for high performance analytics and reporting.

How did you improve the data analysis efficiency of the system?
Answer: I improved the data analysis efficiency of the system by transferring the data to ClickHouse and converting it into a bitmap storage structure, which is highly optimized for querying and processing large sets of data. This allowed the system to process and analyze data more quickly and efficiently, resulting in faster insights and better decision-making.

Can you explain the architecture of the Kong Ear real-time data visualization analysis system?
The architecture of the system includes FlinkCDC, Kafka, Flink, HBase, Redis, and ClickHouse. FlinkCDC is used to capture change data from the source database, which is then sent to Kafka. Flink processes the data in real-time, and the results are stored in HBase, Redis, and ClickHouse.

How did you handle daily running backpressure issues of Flink jobs?
I optimized the FlinkSQL and data governance to reduce the data flow and improve the performance of the Flink jobs.

Can you give an example of a real-time calculation flow that you developed for the system?
One example is a real-time calculation flow that calculates the number of website visits per hour and stores the results in ClickHouse for further analysis.

How did you ensure the quality of the data processed by the system?
I developed a data quality monitoring system that checks for data anomalies and alerts the team if any issues are detected.

How did you optimize the data job development process?
I developed a configuration-based data diversion system that automatically routes data to the appropriate processing job based on the data source and type.

Can you explain how FlinkSQL was used in the system?
FlinkSQL was used to develop real-time calculation flows, allowing for faster development and easier maintenance of the system.
